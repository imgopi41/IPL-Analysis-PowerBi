**I. Descirption**

This is simple Cricket Analysis on Indian Premier League tournament implemented by using Power Bi. In this project i have analyzed all 
the awards by each team individually from First to Present Seasons.

**II. Technology Stack**

Language: Power BI Desktop

IDE used: Microsoft Power BI (2.118. 286.0)


**III. Objective**

I want create a reports of all the seasons played in this tourament by each teams, And also i want to track the data of each team by individually 
with their respective Captains and with Titles from first season which was held in 2008 to present season 2023.


**IV. Things i have Worked on:**

1. Data Cleaning
2. Data Visualizations
3. Reports
4. Dashboards
5. Tiles

**V. Procedures:**

**1.Data Gathering & Data Cleaning:**

Imported CSV file to excel. Performed various activities like checking for duplicates & removing it,
And transforming the data into a format that can be easily analyzed.

**2. Data Visualization:**

To represent information or data into Pictorial format, A Most commonly used tool is Visualization. Where in this IPL Analysis
Dashboard Visualization tools like "Stacked Bar graph", "Pie chart", "Donut Charts", "Maps", & "Tables" were used to the data.
 I have shown Titles won by the Captains and Teams. Here i have used the "Maps" to show the teams with city wise hence i 
have used it to represent in this project. The objective of a visual is to introduce information in a way that gives setting and 
experiences, Both of which would almost certainly hard to perceive from a crude table of numbers or content.

**3. Reports:**

In Power BI, a report is a gathering of perceptions that seem together on at least one page but in this project i have represented the 
data into Grapical format in 2 sheets that is in 2 Pages. Power BI allows to report an accumulation of things that identify with each 
other. IPL Analysis Reports shows you that Titles won by team year-wise. Once we click on any particular team visuals, It shows you the 
complete data of that team in winning awards in that sheet or in a page. I have also created the visuals in a such way that it would be 
easy to understand for the End-User. One can understand the data by seeing the visuals in the Reports.


**4. Dashboards:**

When we prepare to share our data or information, A Power BI Dashboard is used in gathering of visuals from a given data. A Dashboard 
needs to fit on a solitary page frequently called Canvas. Canvas is workshop where we can make, consolidate, and adjust fascinating and 
convincing visuals. In our IPL Analysis Dashboard Visualizations and text were used to represent a Dashboard.

**5. Tiles:**

In Power BI, a Tile is a solitary representation found in a report or on Dashboard. It is the rectangular box that contains every 
individual visual. When we are making a report or a dashboard in Power BI. You can make them greater, change their stature or width, and 
cuddle them up to different tiles any way as per our need.


**VI. Steps involved in this Analysis:**

ðŸ‘‰ Data Gathering : I have imported CSV file to Excel.

ðŸ‘‰ Data Cleaning: Ensuring accurate and reliable results.

ðŸ‘‰Data Analysis: Uncovering Patterns, Trends, and correlations.

ðŸ‘‰Interactive Dashboard: Presenting the findings in a visually appealing manner.

ðŸ‘‰Insights: Extracting valuable information to drive growth.

**VIII. Applications & Future enhancements:**

An Interactive personalized Dashboards and reports of IPL Analysis. This type of Dashboards shows you the improvement and 
growth. We can easily Analyze & work on improvements on particular things. This is Widely used to show the reports in 
Pictorial format in all the Domains, Here in this project Cricket, This kind of Analytics were used around Globally to Analyze the Data.
